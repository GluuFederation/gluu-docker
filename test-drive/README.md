# Test drive Gluu

These are fast deployments of Gluu for demonstration , exploration, and testing purposes. These are **NOT** to be used in any way or form in production. But if you are looking for a good glance at Gluu you came to the right place.

## Examples

[Single Host](./single-host/)

- This is test driving Gluu broken down into microservices in containers at a single node instance using docker and docker-compose.

- The directory contains `README.md` as a guide to deploy a basic single-host Gluu server stack
